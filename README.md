# Random-Bible-Verse
This is a short C++ program that reads from a CSV file and gives the book name, chapter, and verse for a random bible verse. It is intended that a person would open a Bible or Bible app to read the verse given. The reason for this is that while a verse may be able to stand on it's own, sometimes the surrounding verses are needed to understand the correct content.
